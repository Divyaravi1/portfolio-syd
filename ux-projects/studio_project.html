          <h2>TSG Quest</h2>
          <p>The Tin Sheds Gallery, originally a vibrant center for community engagement and political activism, has evolved since its inception in 1969, becoming part of the Sydney School of Architecture, Design, and Planning. Despite its historical significance, the gallery's community engagement has waned over time. 
            To revitalize its relevance, a new housing-themed system has been developed using the gallery's archives. This system aims to foster open dialogue, connecting audiences and enhancing personal connections to the archives and the gallery. By addressing past, present, and future housing challenges, this initiative seeks to reinvigorate community engagement and relevance.
              </p>
              <br>

              <h3>The goal  </h3>
            <p>
              How can we use the past exhibitions about the evolution of housing and potential for design interventions showcased in the gallery to create a dialogue among the youth, invite their participation and collaborate with the architecture and design communities? 
              While multiple concepts for TSGâ€™s future will be explored, creating a platform where community members can interact with each other and the past archives to create new ideas is imperative to keeping the gallery relevant in the coming future.

                  Throughout the development of the TSG QUEST card game, our team worked closely together to refine the game mechanics and ensure a smooth experience for players across different archetypes. As the <strong>UX designer</strong>, I played a key role in designing the user flow, creating the storyboard, and developing the lenses of play and model of engagement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h3>Contributions:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Flow Design:</strong> I mapped out a seamless journey for players through the TSG archives, ensuring intuitive navigation and interaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storyboard Creation:</strong> I developed a visual narrative that outlined key interactions and gameplay scenarios for the TSG QUEST.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lenses of Play and Model of Engagement:</strong> I conceptualized and implemented the lenses of play and model of engagement, aiming to make the game educational and entertaining while aligning with Tin Sheds Gallery's objectives.</li>
                  </ul>
                  This project has significantly improved my game design skills and highlighted the importance of iterative development and user-centered design principles. Moving forward, there are opportunities to further refine game mechanics and increase interactivity to deepen engagement and educational value.

        <h3>Previous Iterations </h3>
        <p>
          
We conducted comprehensive user testing on our initial iteration, gathering valuable insights and feedback.
 Through meticulous analysis of this data, we iteratively refined our approach to meet user needs and preferences. 
This informed our final iteration, ensuring it aligns seamlessly with user expectations and enhances overall user experience.
<br>The Roofs was our intitial iteration, which was a compilation of multiple events (including an event called the TSG Quest, which was later adapted to our final concept). 
We tested the "Timescape" event for the user testing event that was held as a part of our unit.

          In response to our formal user testing findings, how do we modify our design concept to promote deeper engagement with the archives and other users, while still ensuring the user experience is enjoyable and not too difficult? 
          How can our concept foster both the comfort-level and creative spark needed for that deeper engagement to occur? How do we ensure each component has a clear purpose and that the purpose and related expectations are clearly conveyed to users?

              By integrating the key insights garnered from the Bodystorming session into our concept, we aim to enrich discussions surrounding past, present, and future housing issues as well as the TSG archives among players. 
              Our goal is to ensure that these discussions are not only informative but also enjoyable, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
            </br>
              Our focus lies in providing additional context for the archive, ensuring seamless accessibility for users to engage with TSG QUEST.
               Through this approach, we aim to enhance user interaction and facilitate a deeper understanding of the archive's content and significance.

        <p class="fst-italic">
          To structure our audience effectively, we developed the housing archetype quiz with the aim of categorizing users into three distinct archetypes. 
          These archetypes were determined through an online quiz available on our website.
          The quiz was designed in a manner that allows users to quickly answer five questions interactively to define their housing archetype.
          The quiz also serves as the primary gateway for users to sign up for the TSG QUEST.
