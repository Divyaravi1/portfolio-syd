          <h2>Beach Camp</h2>
          <p>While swimming between the designated red and yellow flags provides the highest level of safety on Australian beaches, but it's not always achievable. Beachgoers may not always adhere to this guidance because lifeguards and flags are not present at all times and locations. 
            Less than 5% of Australia's 11,000 beaches are routinely patrolled, mainly during peak seasons, leaving vast stretches unmonitored, especially during off-peak times like early mornings and evenings when beachgoer traffic is high. 
            This limited supervision increases risks for swimmers.
              </p>
              <p>Similar to recent years, 2022/23 revealed a broader and flatter drowning profile across age groups, with between 24-55 year olds making up 68%(weir, 2023) of the coastal drowning burden. Males accounted for four in five drowning deaths , and were five times more likely to drown than females.</p>
              <br>

              <h3>The goal  </h3>
            <p>
              Our goal is to save lives on unpatrolled beaches by partnering with surf lifesavers. Many beachgoers choose unpatrolled beaches due to proximity to accommodations and quieter environments, despite awareness of the safety provided by swimming between the red and yellow flags. 
              This choice has serious consequences, as highlighted by recent data from Surf Life Saving Australia, showing that 75% of coastal drowning deaths in the past decade occurred more than 1 km away from lifesaving services.

                  Throughout the development of Beach Camp, our team collaborated closely to refine the concept and ensure an engaging and educational experience for users. As the UX designer, I played a pivotal role in various stages of the project, from initial research and planning to concept development and implementation.

                  <h3>Contributions:</h3>
                  <p>During the analysis, brief, and planning stage, I conducted technology and behavioral research, reframed the project scope, created initial storyboards, and mapped key stakeholders.</p>
                
                  <p>In the design and concept development stage, I led ideation, conducted journey mapping, performed user engagement assessments, and developed detailed storyboards.</p>
                
                  <p>In the concept implementation stage, I evaluated real-life implications, analyzed the production process, and assessed feasibility and practicality.</p>

                  <p>This project has significantly improved my game design skills and highlighted the importance of iterative development and user-centered design principles. Moving forward, there are opportunities to further refine game mechanics and increase interactivity to deepen engagement and educational value.</p>

        <h3> Reframing of the Breif </h3>
        <p>
          
          Reframing the brief is essential in the design process as it allows for a deeper understanding of the problem and exploration of alternative solutions. By focusing on the theme of introspection and self-accountability,we can foster a change in behaviour at unpatrolled beaches.
           This approach ensures that our solutions are aligned with user needs, guiding us to innovate and create more effective outcomes.

        <p>
          
          We focused on the theme of personal growth in our analysis and explored experiences that prioritize self-improvement. Drawing inspiration from the transformative environment of a Yoga retreat, we envisioned a new approach to our problem.
          This led us to establish design principles aimed at influencing individual behavior on the beach, integrating elements that help people use our intervension and help keep them safe.

            <h4>PREVENTATIVE BEHAVIOUR</h4>
            <p>
              According to <strong>"Prospect Theory"</strong>, an individuals decision making under the threat of risk or uncertainty tend to focus on losses and therefore individuals are more suggestable to preventative behaviour.
               Preventing an incident is from happening is largely a beneficial compared to trying to solve a problem as the problem may have multiple roots that cannot be tackled with one product. Our product aims to divert attention from perceived adventurous activity to something that is fun but largely safer and not putting other people at risk as well. Many regulars at the beach have a perception of being good swimmers and inherently talented in avoiding danger. 
               We intend to provide an alternative rather than change their perception, and over time create a positive co relation to the product which will lead to the usage of the product becoming a ritual when they decide to go to the beach. (Kahneman & Tversky, 1977)

        <h3>What is Beach Camp? </h3>
        <p class="fst-italic">
          <strong>"Beach Camp"</strong> directly addresses the main challenge outlined in the brief: the alarming rates of accidents at unpatrolled beaches due to a lack of awareness and engagement with safety measures.
           By leveraging widely used platforms like Google Maps for<strong>easy access and visibility</strong> , and integrating engaging <strong>AR features and community forums</strong>, Beach Camp transforms beach safety education from a <strong>passive to an active and enjoyable experience.</strong>
            This approach raises awareness about beach hazards also fosters a proactive beachgoing community that values and practices safety, effectively reducing the risks associated with unpatrolled beaches.

          <p class="fst-italic">
            The solution presented by "Beach Camp" is a <strong>strategic and interaction design solution.</strong> 
            It strategically integrates with widely used tools like Google Maps to <strong>leverage existing user habits for greater reach and impact.</strong> 
            The interaction design aspect comes into play with the use of<strong> augmented reality (AR) and gamified elements</strong> that actively engage users in learning about beach safety. This combination addresses the brief's requirement for innovative technology use and also ensures that the education about beach safety is interactive, engaging, and directly integrated into the users' journey to and experience at the beach.

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>
              
                <p><strong>Guidance from Google Maps:</strong>  To enhance the transition to the SLA app, consider implementing clearer prompts or incentives. For example, offering exclusive safety tips or rewards upon app installation could motivate users to make the transition.</p>
                <p><strong>Community Integration</strong> Since the forum module is effective, continue to promote and encourage community interaction. Consider adding features such as live chat sessions with lifeguards or regular safety webinars to further foster connections and safety through companionship.</p>
                <p><strong>AR Adventure Game:</strong> To address accessibility issues such as eye fatigue and adaptation challenges for older users, provide options for users to toggle between AR and non-AR modes. Implement voice-guided instructions or text-based cues for those who prefer not to use AR. Ensure that the game environment is customizable in brightness and contrast to reduce eye strain.</li>
                <p><strong>Gamification and Rewards:</strong> Diversify rewards to appeal to a broader audience. Consider offering physical rewards like beach gear, as well as virtual rewards such as exclusive badges or titles. Ensure that rewards are attainable through various activities, not just through the AR game.</p>
                <p><strong>Competition and Incentives: </strong> To maintain long-term engagement, introduce a variety of challenges that cater to different interests and skill levels. Consider seasonal challenges tied to beach safety events or themed challenges related to environmental awareness.</p>
             
              By implementing these improvements, Beach Camp will evolve into a more inclusive, engaging, and effective platform for promoting beach safety and community engagement. It could also become a part of the beach going ritual and provide entertainment for individual beach goers.
