            <h3>The goal:  </h3>
            <p>
              To create an app which enables user to purchase groceries and then have them delivered right to their door. 
              The application will have a user- friendly and straightforward interface that allows users to easily browse,choose, and purchase things. 
              The users also will be able to monitor their orders, administer their accounts, and view shipping information through the app.

              <p>
                Throughout the development of Smart Crop, our team collaborated closely to refine the grocery delivery concept and ensure a seamless user experience.
              </p>
              
                <h3>Contributions:</h3>
                <p>As the UX designer <strong>responsible for the phone version,</strong> I played a pivotal role in several stages of the project.
                   During the analysis and planning phase, I conducted technology and behavioral research, did the <strong>competitor analysis,</strong> and mapped key stakeholders to ensure alignment.</p>
                   <p> In the design and concept development stage, I led ideation sessions by providing design solutions that could make the process convinient for the users. 
                    During the concept implementation phase, I evaluated <strong>real-life implications</strong> of design decisions, analyzed the production process, and assessed feasibility for implementing features like <strong>retrieval code generation and payment integration.</strong> </p>
              
                    <p> The Smart Crop project has significantly improved my UX design skills and highlighted the importance of iterative development and user-centered design principles. 
                      Moving forward, there are opportunities to further refine features and enhance interactivity to deepen user engagement and satisfaction, ensuring that Smart Crop continues to provide convenience and efficiency in grocery delivery.</p>
